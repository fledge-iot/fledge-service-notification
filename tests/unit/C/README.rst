************************************
C/C++ Notification server Unit Tests
************************************

This directory tree contains the unit tests for the C and C++ Notification server code.

Prequisite
==========

These tests are written using the Google Test framework. This should be installed on your machine

- sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev

Unfortunately this does not install the libraries and a manual build set is required

- cd /usr/src/gtest
- sudo cmake -E make_directory build
- sudo cmake -E chdir build cmake ..
- sudo cmake --build build
- sudo cp build/libgtest* /usr/lib

Running Tests
=============

To run all the unit tests go to the directory scripts and execute the script

- RunAllTests

This will run all unit tests and place the JUnit XML files in the directory results

To generate coverage reports, go to the directory scripts and execute the script as follows:

- RunAllTests coverageHtml

This will run all unit tests and report test coverage results in 'build/CoverageHtml/index.html' file w.r.t. path of CMakeLists.txt files.

- RunAllTests coverageXml

This will run all unit tests and report test coverage results in 'build/CoverageXml.xml' file w.r.t. path of CMakeLists.txt files.

NOTE:
the build process for C++ tests checks first the environment FLEDGE_ROOT (pointing where Fledge has been built)
If the variable is not set then the build process uses FLEDGE_INCLUDE_DIRS and FLEDGE_LIB_DIRS, assuming the Fledge dev package has been installed.

It's possible to override defaults by changing in RunAllTests.sh script the values of FLEDGE_SRC or FLEDGE_INCLUDE_DIRS and FLEDGE_LIB_DIRS before executing it.
